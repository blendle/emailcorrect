# EmailCorrect

E-mail correct is an utility library for auto correcting an user's e-mail address.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jessedijkstra/writing-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jessedijkstra/writing-api)

## Installation
```
npm install --save emailcorrect
```

This assumes that you’re using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) package manager with a module bundler like [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to consume [CommonJS modules](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html).

If you don’t yet use [npm](http://npmjs.com/) or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build that makes `EmailCorrect` available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built version from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/emailcorrect).
